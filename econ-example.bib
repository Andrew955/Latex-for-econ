  abstract     = {This paper develops a two-sector, two-country model, where
                  firms in a differentiated products sector choose between
                  exporting and multinational expansion as alternative modes of
                  foreign market penetration, based on a trade-off between
                  proximity and concentration advantages. The differentiated
                  sector is characterized by multi-stage production, with
                  increasing returns at the corporate level associated with some
                  activity such as R&D, scale economies at the plant level, and
                  a variable transport cost that rises with distance. A pure
                  multinational equilibrium, where two-way horizontal expansion
                  across borders completely supplants two-way trade in
                  differentiated products, is possible even in the absence of
                  factor proportion differences. It is more likely the greater
                  are transport costs relative to fixed plant costs, and the
                  greater are increasing returns at the corporate level relative
                  to the plant level. The model also establishes conditions for
                  a mixed equilibrium, in which national and multinational firms
                  coexist.},
